## Domino 1v1 Player

A program that chooses the best move in a 1v1 domino game based on the pieces it has, the pieces played and the ohter player moves.

The heuristic gives the highest value to a winning position and the lowest to a losing one. It gives the next highest positive value to closing a side of the game for the opponent and the next one to geting rid of a double digit piece in the next move. It also gives a positive/negative value to a more/less diverse set of numbers after the move.
